# Data_Structure_and_Algorithms_Final_Project

This is the source code of the final project for my Data Structure & Algorithms course.

The provided PDF file contains all the specifications that the project had to attain to (NOTE: Everything is written in _Italian_, an English translation will be provided sometime in the future).

The project had to pass a battery of automated tests, provided by an online platform, and a score was given based on the time and memory used during execution (scale: grade/30).

The following table contains the time and memory constraints for each grade:

| Time Limit | Memory Limit | Grade |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| 14 s       | 35 MB        | 18/30 |
| 9          | 30 MB        | 21/30 | 
| 6 s        | 25 MB        | 24/30 |
| 4.5 s      | 20 MB        | 27/30 |
| 3 s        | 15 MB        | 30/30 |
| 1.5 s      | 14 MB        | 30L/30|

This project reached the second to last maximum score of 30/30 (no _cum laude_ due to too much time used, even though memory-wise it was within the 30 _cum laude_ memory requirement).
