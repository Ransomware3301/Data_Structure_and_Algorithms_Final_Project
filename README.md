# Data_Structure_and_Algorithms_Final_Project

This is the source code of the final project for the Data Structure & Algorithms course.

The provided PDF file contains all the specifications that the project had to attain to (NOTE: Everything is written in _Italian_, an English translation will be provided in the future).

The project had to pass a battery of automated tests, provided by an online platform, and a score was given based on the time and memory used during execution (scale: grade/30).

This project reached the second to last maximum score of 30/30 (no _cum laude_ due to too much time used, even though memory-wise it was within the 30 _cum laude_ memory requirement).
